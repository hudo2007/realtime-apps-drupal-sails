  <h1>About the Tool</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The dCAREHx tool was created to enable physicians, pharmacists, nurses, patients, care providers, and general consumers to understand the adverse events related from taking a particular mental health drug, and the frequency on which cases were submitted. The dCAREHx tool is specifically designed to help those who are taking or prescribing pharmaceuticals to understand if there are potentially adverse side effects from a particular medication as well as the number of cases reported over a period of time. It is based on official FDA data, and reduces the research time substantially.</p>
<p>dCAREHx is open-source, and is maintained on <a href="https://github.com/forumone/18F-ADSBPA-Pool-2-Dev-">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The data in this tool is pulled directly from the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). It includes data that came in from both mandatory and voluntary reporting. 
<a href="https://open.fda.gov/data/faers/">Learn more about FAERS.</a></p>
<h2>Limitations of the dCAREHx Tool</h2>
<p>Timeline: Because medications change over time, we are showing data for the last 5 years. In a future phase we may add the ability to select the time period over which adverse events have been measured and reported.</p>
<p>Medical Advice Disclaimer: This tool should not be used as a substitute for medical advice from a physician. If you have questions about the data, the results, or any of the information you find in this too, please contact your physician to discuss the information directly.</p>
